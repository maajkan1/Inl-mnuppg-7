      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! I'm Rasmus Bäckström, a 38-year-old living in Hjo, Sweden. I
        recently left my job in industrial manufacturing to pursue a career as a
        system developer. I'm currently studying Java and JavaScript at Lernia
        University as part of a two-year program that covers HTML & CSS,
        JavaScript, Frontend, Backend, and Fullstack development. With my
        passion for computers and IT, curiosity, and previous work experience,
        I'm excited about this new journey.
